📊 Introducing My Data-Driven Project: Analyzing Attrition Rates

I'm thrilled to share a data-driven project I've been working on, focused on unraveling the intricacies of employee attrition within our organization. Using the power of data analytics and Power BI, I've delved into the dynamics of attrition rates, with a spotlight on factors such as department, salary, and tenure.

🛠️ Data Cleaning and Transformation: One of the foundational steps in this journey was cleaning and transforming our data. We meticulously refined our datasets using Power Query in Power BI, ensuring accuracy and reliability.



📈 Key Findings:

Overall Attrition Rate: We found that our overall attrition rate stands at 16%. This data-driven analysis helps us understand the trends and take proactive measures.

Departmental Insights: Digging deeper, we discovered variations in attrition across departments. It's clear that different teams have unique dynamics.

Consequence of pay: A significant number of departures were linked to salaries below the company average. Addressing this can have a positive impact on retention.

Tenure Matters: The data also showed that some employees leave after just one year, while others stay for five years or more. Understanding these patterns is key to retention strategies.



📊 Power BI in Action: This project was made possible with Power BI, a powerful tool for visualizing and understanding complex data. It's been an eye-opener to witness the power of data analytics in HR and organizational management.
